\section{Proposed error estimation strategy}

The planned approach to perform the adjoint-based error estimation (covered in Section \ref{section:Adjoint}) will utilize the following techniques:

\begin{itemize}
\item Block-based adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
\item Finite volume method (FVM)
\item Large eddy simulation (LES)
\item Combustion modeling via the presumed conditional moment and flame propagation for intrinsic low-dimensional manifold (PCM-FPI) model
\item Error estimation
\item Adjoint-based method for error estimation
\item Error estimation indicators
\end{itemize}

Each of these techniques will now be discussed in turn.
