The CFFC code was used to run a simulation for a turbulent premixed methane flame, using 800 nodes, 3200 blocks and each block having $8^3 = 512$ cells, hence a total of $1,638,400$ cells. Time averaged results for t=6ms, 7ms, 8ms, 9ms, 10ms and 11ms are shown in figure~\ref{fig:oxygen}, the contours representing the species concentration of Oxygen.\par


Included here are some pictures from previous CFFC simulations that show the varying mesh cell sizes among the different blocks.
